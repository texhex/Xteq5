A known issues testing framework, powered by PowerShell scripts.

Computer systems today are complex. Some years ago, if software A did not run, the reason was "A requires B and B is not installed". Today it’s more like "A does not run because B is not working as the value C in D is not set by E". 

Using Xteq5, you could now write PowerShell scripts that test A, B, C, D and E. The generated HTML report ([Example][_examplereport]) will then inform you if, and what, isn’t right. From that time on, you don’t have to remember this case anymore. Just run Xteq5 again and you will be informed in seconds. This can also be done silently using the command line, resulting in a XML or JSON report for further automated processing. 

This procedure can lead to cost savings if you have separated 1st and 2nd level support teams. The 1st level support can check with Xteq5 if the problem is already known and fix it without escalating to 2nd level. This means higher first call resolution rates for 1st level and less tickets for 2nd level.
